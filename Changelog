V1.1:
	fixed bug in event library where event_poll would return 0 if 
the first source in the pool emitted an event. this was only not a 
problem because event-dev-input uses readdir which does not sort by 
filename meaning some device that isn't the keyboard or mouse was being 
ignored.
	
	fixed some other logical oversights in event.c
	
	added Changelog and version info
V1.0:
	Version 1.0 named from
	commit: ce42dca3450026ff98f5b34e0adb9b1692fc8655
