Standalone Audio Daemon (SAD)

This program is meant to allow the raspberry pi to be used as a standalone audio player.

	Basically it acts as a control interface to a running vlc instance. Specifically, it
filters through all input events on the system for xf86 media keypresses which are generated by some keyboards, or in this case through the gpio-keys driver. The polling loop can also be easily modified to search for other types of events. VLC was chosen over a homebrew media player for stability and simplicity purposes. Overall, the program works more or less well enough for basic testing of a mobile pi based music player.
